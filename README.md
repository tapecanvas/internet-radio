# this is a work in progress!
- **requires internet connection (wifi or ethernet) and mpv to be installed (not sure if it's installed by default?)**
    - to check/install mpv:
        - ssh into norns `ssh we@norns.local`
        - run `sudo apt install mpv` 
- a great use for norns when you're not actively making music on it
- also a test of github copilot
- inspired by @mlogger 's idea in https://llllllll.co/t/norns-ideas/17625/1328

# currently
- hardcoded table of streams
- E3 scrolls through list
- K3 plays selected stream (also stops previously playing stream before playing a new stream)
- K2 stops playback

# to-do
- volume control
- radio as script / tape input (https://llllllll.co/t/norns-ideas/17625/1332) ty @infinitedigits as always (:
- keyboard/encoder input to add streams
- way to favorite streams / bump to top of list
- delete / modify / rename option
